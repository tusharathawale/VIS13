Instructions for Ubuntu:

1) Extract ijkmcube, isotable and lib folders to a project directory (prj_dir)

2) Navigate to prj_dir/ijkmcube folder (and delete CMakeCache.txt if one exists)

3) Now, reconfigure project using following commands:

-Type "ccmake ." and "c" twice to configure.

-Check that IJK_DIR is set to project directory. [Here: prj_dir]
(If not, modify the path for IJK_DIR.)

-Check that IJK_ISOTABLE_DIR is set to directory containing the isosurface lookup tables. [Here: prj_dir/isotable]
(If not, modify the path for IJK_ISOTABLE_DIR.)

-Check that LIBRARY_OUTPUT_PATH is set to directory containing libraries (libteem and libexpat). [Here: prj_dir/lib]
(If not, modify the path for LIBRARY_OUTPUT_PATH.)

-Press "g" to generate the Makefile and exit.

-Type "cmake .".

-Type "make" to create executable "ijkmcube".

-Type "make install" to install executables in ${IJK_DIR}/bin.		

Please install the isosurface visualization software "geomview"

sudo apt-get install geomview

In case of uniform density, the cell configuration corresponding to mean is same as the most probable cell configuration.
So, the same executable "ijkmcube" can be used to get isosurface corresponding to mean and most probable configurations.
However, the source code for computing most probable configuration is included. Please comment a call to "extract_iso_simplices"
at line 538 in ijkmcube.cxx and uncomment a call to "extract_iso_simplices" at line 534. Again, recompile the code.

sample command:

./ijkmcube -interpolate "alpha_uncertainty" 56 fuel.nrrd

fuel.nrrd represents mean grid and 2_fuel.nrrd represents delta grid. Both must be placed in the working folder.

The above command creates fuel.isov=56.off file. This can be visualized using "geomview" software using following command:

geomview fuel.isov=56.off

In the old version of code, "alpha_uncertainty_coord" function in "ijkinterpolate.txx" file is different from one in the new version.
